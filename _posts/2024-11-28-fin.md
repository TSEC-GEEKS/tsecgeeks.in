_This post marks the end._

It has been over two years since a new post was published here, and there's not much more to add. I started this community with the goal of bringing together individuals who share a passion for technology and a desire to learn. It has been an enjoyable experience, but like many things, it has naturally wound down due to internal differences within the community.

Despite the slowdown in activity, it’s truly humbling to see that the articles on this site are still being shared in WhatsApp groups — something I never expected to continue. For that reason, I’ve decided to keep the site live with all the posts from the original authors, even though there are no guarantees that the links will remain active. If you're a junior from TSEC and need guidance or support, feel free to reach out.

Please note that there will be no further updates to this site.

Goodbye.
