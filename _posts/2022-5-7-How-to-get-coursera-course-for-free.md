title: How to get paid coursera course for free.
---

Hello Geeks,

Welcome! In this article, I am going to demonstrate how you can get the coursera paid courses free of cost. This process is applicable for any paid course whether technical or non-technical. Process remains the same for all cases.

Let's get started,

### Step 1:
Go to [Coursera's website.](https://www.coursera.org) and navigate to the course you wish to enroll in.
#### We will advise you to enrol in reputable and well-reviewed courses. [Link to those is here.](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/)


### Step 2:
 Beneath the course description, you'll find and option to apply financial aid. Click on 'financial aid available'.
 
 
![financial aid available]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera1.png "financial aid available")

A popup window shall appear informing you about the application review period. Click on continue to the application.


### Step 3:
Now you have to fill your **background information**.
For availing benefits, it is recommended to enter annual income as zero and enter employment status as student.


Next you will be asked to answer a few questions, first being


**"Why are you applying for financial aid ?"**

#### (The answers should be written in 150 words. A sample answer has been attached below, it is adviced to write on in order to avoid getting rejected.)

> Sample answer

> I am a first-year bachelor of engineering student at Thadomal Sahani Engineering College. As I work in the technical field and have a strong desire to learn, I am interested in taking this Data Science course on Coursera. However, the course is paid, and as a student, I currently do not have any source of income and am completely reliant on my family to support my education. Financial aid will enable me to complete this course with ease. I am determined to complete the course and learn more about the subject of data science. A certified certificate from Coursera will enhance my résumé, which will aid me in my job search. I pledge to finish all assignments by the due dates. I will also participate in conversations and assist my peers if they require assistance.


### Step 4:
#### Part 2 of the application form.
Here they will ask you questions like how much can you pay for the course and *How will this course help you with your goals*, etc.
(Again this is the subjective question)


> Sample answer

> As I am enrolled in a technical degree, this course will be highly beneficial to my profession, and a certified certificate from Coursera will help me strengthen my résumé and stand out from the crowd. I am very enthusiastic in learning about and exploring this topic. This training will improve my performance as a Data Scientist and provide me with a solid foundation. In today's world, competition is fierce, and everyone strives for a competitive advantage. The competition in today's world is very hard to deal with and every body wants to have a upper hand. Learning from the greatest in their area is always a privilege, and for a course like this, it will be even better because it has a lot of potential to become one of the most challenging jobs in the future. Having experience will help me get forward in the beginning. I also want to make progress and put it into practise. 



### Step 5:
 Submit your application and wait for 15 days to receive a response!
 Check your mail, once approved - you will receive an email something like this.

 That's it for today. I hope this post helped y'all.
 
 Thank you!
