##### Author's note: Please do read the entire post and visit the approprate links where attached. A great care has been taken into writing this and formulating the resources. If you come some new term, please do not assume and learn it's meaning. 

### What is CP?


Competitive Programming. It's more of a mind sport than a coding challenge.
CP is all about time constraint and accuracy .



### Why do CP?
It helps you in developing Problem Solving attitude. Doing it for jobs is one thing, but all cuts down to developing a problem solving attitude.



### How to get started with CP?


### 1 : Learn a language. 


#### Which programming language to choose from?

**Fact :** Language doesn't matter. You can start with any.
*Opinion*: If you're a beginner, you can start with C++. 
Java syntax can be overwhelming . Python is not recommended to start, it will spoil you.
**Another Fact:** There are certain performance benefits of using C++, however there are several people such as Petr (Java) and pajanegod (Python) who have reached 2400+ on Codeforces without using C++.

#### How do I get started with learning a language?
Any place which covers the basics right works.
Opinion: Focus more on doing it than sticking to books or tutorials. A great place to evaluate your skills can be hackerrank. 
Hackerrank > Prepare By Topics > Choose A Language.



### Level 2: Practice. 
Now is the time to dig codeforces or codechef. 


**Getting Started on** [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/selflearning/0to1stars) , [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?Order=BY_RATING_ASC) 


**Problems on** [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/practice?End_rating=999) , [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?Order=BY_RATING_ASC) .


*( difficulty increasing progressively )* 



### Level 3: Give Contest

#### What are contests?
Solving a few problem statements under given amount of time. They are a great way to upskill yourself and maintain good speed.

Give contests with your peer group *(more at the end)*. Now after giving a contest, compare your code with with someone with good rating and someone who's code you can understand. Discuss.



#### Some contests suggestions.

Strategies :
- Solving effectively
- Taking part in contest
- **Upsolving*** 
- Editorial Reading.

**Upsolving**: 
Solve the sums you couldn't do. Look at others code their way of implementation.
While reading editorial. Now just don't read the entire code.
Read one line try to think what next line might be, next second line...and so on.
If you don't understand, then see the whole code.



### Mistakes To Avoid.
Avoid switching between problems.
Now if you're coding your subconscious mind keeps thinking about the previous question. So don't switch in between problems until and unless you've exhausted your thoughts.

One thing, don't solve a same rating problem continuously. There will be a point where you'll realize that you're comfortable with these level sums. Increase the difficulty gradually. 

For beginners please don't wait to solve complete tutorials. Chances are you'll forget overtime. Practice.

Writing the code is the easiest thing to do. 
Thinking about how should you proceed and finding the corner case is something which will make you a problem solver. Then comes implementation.
Read the problem statement properly. Don't use the hint until it's too necessary.




### Contests to look if you are beginner : 
- [Atcoders.jp](atcoders.jp), ABC every Saturday 5 pm 
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com), STAERTER every Wednesday 8 pm




#### Some Prestigious Contests:
- ICPC (Internation Collegiate Programming Contest)
- Google Kickstart
- Hashcode 
- FB Hackercup
- Codechef Snackdown




### Looking for peers?
If you are beginner and looking for peers or post contest discussions, you are free to join
