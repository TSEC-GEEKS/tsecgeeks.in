---

Hello Geeks,


Welcome! In this article, I am going to show you How to get the coursera paid courses free of cost.This process is applicable for any paid course whether technical or non-technical doesn't matter. Process is same for all.

Let's start,

### STEP 1:
Go to coursera's website. Or click here <https://www.coursera.org/>
Select the course you want to enroll

### STEP 2:
 Click on 'financial aid available'.

A popup window with a warning that it will take 15 days to review etc. will appear. Click on continue to the application.

### STEP 3:
Now you have to fill your **background information** like college degree, annual income (Type "0"), employment status (student) etc.

Next question will ask you,
" *why are you applying for financial aid ?*"

(==The answers should be written in 150 words.I am giving a sample answer for it but I will advise you to write it on your own or make some changes because if everyone writes it then all applications will become same and thus a lot of chances for your application is to get rejected==)

> Sample answer

> I am a first-year bachlor of engineering student at Thadomal Sahani Engineering College. Because I work in the technical field and have a strong desire to learn, I am interested in taking this Data Science course on Coursera. However, the course is paid, and as a student, I currently do not have any source of income and am completely reliant on my family to support my education. Financial aid will enable me to complete this course with ease. I am determined to complete the course and learn more about the subject of data science. A certified certificate from Coursera will enhance my résumé, which will aid me in my job search. I pledge to finish all assignments by the due dates. I will also participate in conversations and assist my peers if they require assistance.

### STEP 4:
#### Part 2 of the application form.
Here they will ask you questions like how much can you pay for the course and *How will this course help you with your goals*,etc.
(Again this is the subjective question)

> Sample answer

>As I am studying Information technology , this course is very useful for my career and also a verified certificate from coursera will help me improve my resume and stand out among the crowds. I am very much committed and interested in learning and exploring this field. This course will help me perform better in my career as a Data Scientist and provide me with a strong base. The competition in today's world is very hard to deal with and every body wants to have a upper hand. To learn from the best in their field is always a privelege , and for course such as this will be amazing as it has a lot of potential in future to become one of the most demanding job. Having an expertise will give me a boosts in the initial stage. Further , I really want to make progress and implement it.

### STEP 5:
 Submit your application and wait for 15 days to receive a response!
